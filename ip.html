        <td>An Internet application is a client-server application that uses standard Internet protocols for connecting the client to the server. You can use exactly the same techniques to create a true Internet application, which is available
          publicly through the World-Wide Web, or to create an intranet application.Internet applications are thin-client, thick-server. This means that the client end, the part the end-user sees and interacts with, is only responsible for the user
          interface. The client runs on a Web browser - the standard tool for accessing the Internet. All the processing is done at the server end, where your corporate data is.
          Because your applications use standard Internet protocols for client-server communications, you can make your applications cross-platform. You write the server-side programs in Micro Focus COBOL, so you can run them on UNIX servers or
          Windows NT (you need to purchase Micro Focus Net Express to run applications on Windows NT).
          Alternatively you can exploit the support Server Express provides for using Java and COBOL components together in a distributed application, with the Java component providing the server-side functionality, and communicating with the COBOL
          component running elsewhere in the network. For further information about using COBOL and Java together, see your Distributed Computing book.</td>

        <td>A server-side program only runs for long enough to process some data and return a result. The end-user has the illusion that the application is running all the time, when the application in fact consists of a series of transactions which
          run for a short time and then disappear.
          An application based on a symmetric server-side program (see the previous section for an explanation of this term) works like this:
          An end-user clicks a link on a Web page which starts a server-side program running.
          The server-side program runs, and sends back an HTML page, containing a form for the application.
          The end-user fills in the form and clicks a button to submit it.
          This runs the server-side program again.
          The server-side program fetches some data, and returns it to the end-user's browser in the form.
          There are many possible variations on the above sequence. For example, the demonstration CGI application supplied with Server Express (use Infomgr to access demonstration applications) starts with an input form, which executes a CGI program
          that returns a simple HTML page. The types of asymmetric server-side program discussed briefly in the previous section might be more complex, but the essential point is that server-side programs only run long enough to return a result.</td>
